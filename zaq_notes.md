| - add mode to load patterns without mutes (hold load+mute)                                                                                                   | It took me a while to understand how to do this. Describe it differently. Maybe describe it as "To toggle this behavior on and off, press the Mixer button while holding down the Load button". Otherwise, Awesome! |   |
| - changes in store menu to prevent accidental overwrite: hold store+pattern button to store pattern                                                          | Can the timeout on the store message be a little longer?                                                                                                                                                            |   |

|  - reworked note repeat feature for independent repeats of tracks and all single drum instruments,                                                           | Very Nice!                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   |
|  - added extensive remote controllability through Midi CCs,-                                                                                                 | I'm not sure exactly what is new here, but I will try to mess with CCs stuff more                                                                                                                                   |   |
| added experimental encoder half-speed mode to support detented encoders,(hold "Note Velocity" at startup to select slow encoder speed - will not get stored) | I don't have these style encoders.                                                                                                                                                                                  |   |
